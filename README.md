# CalcDojo

The purpose of this dojo is to practice writing recursion and string operations.

Someone once said:
> **eval() is Evil**

Of course, eval() is not always evil, even if someone once said it.
However, let's assume it is for us, at least while you're working on this project.



## What is this program ##

This is just a simple program - it just evaluates math formula.


## What to do

There is one spec file with a list of all unit tests that need to pass. Most of them are disabled, only the first one is enabled.
That is sufficient to make them fail. 

To follow the best TDD practice are not allowed to write more code that is needed to make this test passing. That's fine.
However, you're also not allowed to write more unit tests at once - that's why most of them are disabled.
Please follow this TDD master rule and go one by one, never enable more than one test!
